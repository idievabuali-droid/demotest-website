Fresh Starter

This workspace was cleaned and a minimal starter scaffold was created.

What's included:

- `index.html` - a simple tailwind-based starter page
- `img/` - empty folder for your images

Next steps:

- Add your assets to `img/` and edit `index.html`
- Run a quick static server or open `index.html` in your browser

If you'd like, I can scaffold a React/Vite project, a Node backend, or a full storefront nextâ€”tell me which.
